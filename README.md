# Minimalism
>  Minimalism is not a trend. It's an enduring visual discipline that has influenced every facet of visual culture, including art, architecture, industrial design, photography, music, fashion and graphic design. It's a form of restraint that comes to the fore as a reaction to overly ornate and expressive graphic trends, oftern during the times of social flux.
